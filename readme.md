# pokemon-manager-data

Plugin for Foundry VTT that pulls data from [pokemon-manager-2](https://github.com/corvimae/pokemon-manager-2) and creates move macros and Pokemon actors.

A "Sync Pokemon Manager data" button will appear under the Compendium tab. Running it again will overwrite
the existing macros and actors.
